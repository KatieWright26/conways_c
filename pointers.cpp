//function to create an array of booleans (think a row of conways cells) 
//function takes an integer for the size of the array and returns a pointer to the array it created
//We're going to need to use malloc for this. But try it first and see if it works without. If you do this without malloc, your array will be on the stack, not the heap.
//Why do we need to use the heap not the stack here? Do some googling and see if you can explain it in your own words.


// extra for experts:
// Pointer arithmetic and indexes
int main(){
  printf("%u\n", 1);

  //create an int.
  //
  //create a pointer to an int
  //
  //modify the int through the pointer
  //

  
}
