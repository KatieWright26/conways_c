- You already know how to program in another language.
- You've never written any c before
- Bonus if:
  - You've written conways game of life in your language of choice.
  - You're familiar with a test driven development. This exercise has tests that you will make pass. Being able to read the tests will help guide you.

## [Test your dev setup](setup.md)

## [Debug a program](debugging.md)
